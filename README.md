# strnum (String to Number function)
You don't actually use this function, use stof, stod, stoi, stol, etc from 'string' library to convert a string to a number.

What this function does is like stod function, since the type of the function (strnum) or return value of the function is 'double' data type.
There is no special about this code, but if you curious then go ahead and see how this code convert string to number.
 
The output of this function might be **inacurate** because the 'type or return value' of the function itself, it is a floating point/decimal number/double data type.
Computer can't always represent floating point accurately.
For example :
 â€¢ Computer might represent 3 as the number 2.99999999999999 or the number 3.000000000000001, due to limitation on number storage structure
   fractions on the computer.
 
Regarding the above description, I may be giving wrong information, I am stil learning the basic programming and somehow built this function.
